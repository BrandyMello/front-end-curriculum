3. do work
4. commit (add, commit)
5. `git checkout master`
6. `git pull origin master`
7. `git checkout [branch-name]`
8. `git merge master`
9. fix conflicts! (tells you on command line where to look in editor)
10. run tests if applicable
11. `git push origin [branch-name]`
12. go to GitHub! (hub browse)
13. create a pull request(make sure its going to the right place)
14. hit the 'submit pull request' button
15. contact partner to review pull request
16. partner merges pull request
17. `git checkout master`, `git pull origin master`, and repeat the process
