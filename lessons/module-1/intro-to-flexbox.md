* child
* container
* item

* property
* value

## What is FlexBox? âœ…

Flexbox is a part of CSS that provides a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container. It helps us when we have those silly block elements, that even with `display: inline-block`, can be hard to do just what we want them to do.

## Parents and Children âœ…

As we start working with Flexbox, a very important distinction should be pointed out. We need to be careful about the CSS rules we apply to a parent element vs. those to a child element. A **parent** element wraps other elements, a **child** is nested inside the parent.

Let's look an some HTML to make sure we are all on the same page:

```html
<section>
  <article></article>
  <article></article>
  <article></article>
</section>
```

In the code above, the `section` is the parent element, and the 3 `article`s are all children elements because they are directly nested inside of that `section`. Let's looks at one more example:

```html
<section>
  <article>
    <h2>Title of Article 1</h2>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Title of Article 2</h2>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Title of Article 3</h2>
  </article>
</section>
```

In the code above, we now have these `h2` elements nested inside of the `article`s. It's important to know that `h2` is **not** a direct child of the `section`. It is technically a grandchild, and a child of `article`. The idea of **direct child** is really important to understand as we work with Flexbox.

When we use Flexbox, we will make the parent elements `flex containers` and the children elements `flex items`. There isn't really a difference between the two, but you'll need to know that vocabulary to successfully navigate documentation.

## Creating a Flex Container

Without Flexbox, 10 colorful `article`s might look like this:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="36709" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="turing-kwk" data-slug-hash="bJKmLB" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexbox: Normal Block Elements">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/turing-kwk/pen/bJKmLB/">
  Flexbox: Normal Block Elements</a> by Turing KWK (<a href="https://codepen.io/turing-kwk">@turing-kwk</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
<br>

But with Flexbox, we can start having some control over them:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="36709" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="turing-kwk" data-slug-hash="Pgayxz" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1.0em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexbox: Applying Flexbox">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
<br>

After applying `display: flex;` to the container, we observe that the items are now aligned in a horizontal row.

## Flex Direction

Another CSS property with Flexbox is `direction`. This property takes one of four values:

- `row` (default): left-to-right
- `row-reverse`: opposite of row (right-to-left)
- `column`: same as `row` but top to bottom
- `column-reverse`: same as `column` but bottom to top

## Justify Content

We frequently see white space (margin or padding) used, and the content is **centered** on the screen. We can use Flexbox to center content:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="37136" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="ameseee" data-slug-hash="xoWJYb" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexbox: Justify Content">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
<br>

But the items are still all crunched together. They might need some breathing room too, which can be achieved with margin.

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Justify Content</h2>
  <p>On the container's CSS rule, change the code to: <code class="try-it-code">justify-content: space-between;</code>. What happens?</p>
  <p>Now try: <code class="try-it-code">justify-content: space-around;</code>. What is the difference between around and space-between?</p>
  <p>Finished early? Learn about even more values that we can provide to <code class="try-it-code">justify-content</code> with <a target="blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/j/justify-content/">CSS Tricks</a>.</p>
</div>

The `justify-content` property allows us to control how our content sits _on the main axis_.

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Justify Content</h2>
  <p>On the container's CSS rule, change the code to: <code class="try-it-code">flex-direction: column; justify-content: center;</code>. What happens? Why do you think that is?</p>
</div>

## Align Items

Just like we can control how our content sits on the main axis with `justify-content`, we have a tool to control how our content sits _on the cross-axis_. Check out the CodePen below. Try changing the value for `align-items` to `flex-end`, then `flex-start`, and see what happens!

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="36709" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="turing-kwk" data-slug-hash="mgKQOR" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexbox: Align Items">
