## Learning Goals

* Explain the difference between a parent and child element, be able to identify direct children
* Apply Flexbox to containers in order to achieve a desired layout

## Prep

Students should read the first portion of the lesson (all sections marked with âœ…), until you see the Stop Signs (ðŸ›‘).

## Vocabulary âœ…

* parent
* child
* container
* item
* Flexbox
* property
* value

## What is FlexBox? âœ…

Flexbox is a part of CSS that provides a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container. It helps us when we have those silly block elements, that even with display: inline-block, can be hard to do just what we want them to do.

## Parents and Children âœ…

As we start working with Flexbox, a very important distinction should be pointed out. We need to be careful about the CSS rules we apply to a parent element vs. those to a child element. A **parent** element wraps other elements, a **child** is nested inside the parent.

Let's look an some HTML to make sure we are all on the same page:

```html
<section>
  <article></article>
  <article></article>
  <article></article>
</section>
```

In the code above, the `section` is the parent element, and the 3 `article`s are all children elements because they are directly nested inside of that `section`. Let's looks at one more example:

```html
<section>
  <article>
    <h2>Title of Article 1</h2>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Title of Article 2</h2>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Title of Article 3</h2>
  </article>
</section>
```

In the code above, we now have these `h2` elements nested inside of the `article`s. It's important to know that `h2` is **not** a direct child of the `section`. It is technically a grandchild, and a child of `article`. The idea of **direct child** is really important to understand as we work with Flexbox.

When we use Flexbox, we will make the parent elements `flex containers` and the children elements `flex items`. There isn't really a difference between the two, but you'll need to know that vocabulary to successfully navigate documentation.

Identify the containers and items each time Flexbox is used.
