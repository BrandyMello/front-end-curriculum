## Goals

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

* Give professional and actionable feedback through code reviews
* Recognize what makes a README useful
* File and organize issues with labels, that are closed through PRs



## Filing Issues

Filing issues is an important part of the workflow process. It allows you to:

* keep track of what type of work needs to be done
* how that work should be prioritized
* when that work is due
* who is responsible for that work

In addition to these benefits, having an up-to-date list of issues will also indicate to potential employers that you're aware of what could be improved, and you plan on continuing to maintain the project in the future. Sometimes the code we have hosted on GitHub gets a little old and crusty, and doesn't showcase our current skills the best they could. Issues are a great way to say "I'm aware and I'm working on it!"

* milestones
* assignments

### Additional Tooling for Issue Tracking

Besides GitHub issues, there are other popular issue tracking tools that you might utilize on the job. Some of the more common are:

* Trello
* Waffle.io
* Jira

Often times, these tools provide you with a slightly more robust tracking interface for your projects, and still have the ability to hook directly into GitHub issues.

## Writing READMEs 

A README is often the first thing people will see when they visit an open source project. It's vital that this document provides visitors with the information they need in a clear and efficient manner. Often times, the README determines whether or not people will work with or explore your project further.

## Code Review

The code review process, when done well (or even poorly!), can be one of the most enlightening parts of the collaboration process. Not only does it bring technical advancement and insight, but it can also help identify areas for improvement with communication.
