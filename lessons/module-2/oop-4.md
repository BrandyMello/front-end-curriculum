## Learning Goals

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Synthesize your understanding of objects and OOP principles
- Compare and contrast several different implementations of a game based on your knowledge of OOP thus far
- Assess the pros and cons of approaching the same problem in a variety of ways
- Identify code smells

## Structure

* 30 mins of research and journaling
* 15 mins of group discussion
* 30 - 40 mins of code review

#### Research (20 minutes)

Take a few minutes to go through the readings listed below. Take note of your thoughts and questions as you read. Make a habit of condensing and paraphrasing what you read. As you finish each section or page, how well can you explain key terms and ideas without reproducing the authorâ€™s words? You will have an opportunity to discuss your findings within your small group.

* [SOLID Principles](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)
  
  _Note: Although the code examples are in PHP, these design principles still apply to JavaScript. As of yet, JavaScript does not support `interfaces` without using outside libraries like `Implement.js`. TLDR: both `implements` and `extends` create subtypes. The former sets up a "contract" to implement the methods declared in the supertype, the latter inherits code from the supertype_

* [Code Smells](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/)


#### Journal (10 minutes)

After you have finished reading the four articles, answer the following questions:
- What constitutes code that follows good OOP principles?
- Define "code smell." Name at least 3 specific examples of a code smell from a current or previous project.
- What new information have you learned from one (or all) of these readings?
- What questions do you have after reading through these?

#### Discussion (15 mins)

Using the journal questions to guide you, start a discussion within your small groups. 

#### Code Review & Paired Discussion

[*Wheel of Fortune*](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/oop-review/tree/master/wheel-of-fortune)

While reviewing the code, ask yourself the following questions:

* Is all the code easily understood?
* Does it conform to Turing's Style Guide? These will usually cover location of braces, variable and function names, line length, indentations, formatting, and comments.
* Is there any redundant or duplicate code?
* Does the code follow the principle of single responsibility?
* Do the names used in the application convey intent?
