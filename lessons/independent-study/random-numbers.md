### Generating Random Numbers
 
 JavaScript has a fun function called `Math.random()`. It will generate some crazy decimal between 0 and 1. That's cool, but what if we want to get a number between 1 and 3?
 
 Elementary! Multiply it by three!
 
 Hmmâ€¦ That's still not getting us all the way there. Here are a few numbers that I generated.
 
 - 0.983854177263559
 - 1.2686074516508812
 - 2.8046332459732235
 - 2.249551404129546
 - 2.573826382472637
 - 2.224357980788116
 - 1.2507436439851465
 - 1.9703391399107906
 - 2.48614382491825
 
 They are between 0 and just under 3. We need to add one and then round down. `Math.floor()` will round the number down.
 
 ```
 Math.floor(2.48614382491825) === 2; // true!
 ```
 
 So, what happens if we do `Math.floor(Math.random() * 3 + 1)`?
 
 - 2
 - 3
 - 1
 - 2
 - 3
 - 1
 - 3
 - 2
 
 We did it! ðŸŽ‰
