## LifeCycle Methods: An Interactive Adventure

Later this year (2018), the React team will unveil **async rendering**. Per the [docs](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html#new-core-architecture), this is "a strategy for cooperatively scheduling rendering work by periodically yielding execution to the browser. The upshot is that, with async rendering, apps are more responsive because React avoids blocking the main thread." This is going to play a big part in the future of React. In anticipation of this release, React has begun making some changes that will help prepare us for async rendering. Among those changes are getting rid of some lifecycle methods that are now considered UNSAFE to use and adding a few new lifecycle methods. 

We talked earlier this week about the Birth/Mounting Phase that a class based React component goes through when it is created. Today we are going to spend a little time learing about the other 2 phases of a component's lifecycle. You're going to split up into 5 groups and each group will be given a lifecycle method to research and learn about. You will then teach the rest of the class about your assigned lifecycle method. There are a number of resources at the bottom of this lesson that you can use, but by no means are you limited to just the ones here. 

## Phase 1: Birth/Mounting (see [previous lesson](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-3/react-basic-lifecycle-methods-and-propTypes.html)) 

### constructor()

You've seen this before, this is where we call the inherited constructor
(`super`), and set our initial state.

### componentWillMount() - *will be deprecated with React 17*

This legacy method is now **unsafe** to use and should be replaced with 
`componentDidMount()`.

### static getDerivedStateFrom Props - *NEW with React 16.3.0*

### render()

### componentDidMount()
 
## Phase 2: Growth/Updating  

### componentWillReceiveProps() - *will be deprecated with React 17*

This legacy method is now **unsafe** to use, and should be replaced with `static
getDerivedStateFromProps()`.

### static getDerivedStateFromProps - *NEW with React 16.3.0*

Since this method is static, you can't refernece `this` in it. Whatever object
is returned from this method is what the state of the component will be set to.
This new method will be called on the initial mounting of the component, as well
as when it's re-rendered.

### shouldComponentUpdate()

### componentWillUpdate() - *will be deprecated with React 17*

This legacy method is now **unsafe** and shouldn't be used going forward.

### getSnapshotBeforeUpdate - *NEW with React 16.3.0*

This method is called right before any DOM manipulations are made. If you need
to do any calculations that you'd like to use in componentDidUpdate(), you can
return those in this method, and they will get passed along as a the third
argument to componentDidUpdate()

### render()

### componentDidUpdate()

## Phase 3: Death/Unmounting  

### componentWillUnmount()

## Error Handling

### componentDidCatch() - *just know this exists*
