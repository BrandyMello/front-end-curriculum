## Unit Testing React Components

When testing React apps, or really when testing any kind of application, most of
the tests your write will be *unit tests*. Unit tests make sure that small,
isolated, parts (units) of our application behave as expected. The more we can
write our code in a way that is testable at the unit level, the easier it will
be to scale and extend our applications.

**_Turn and talk_: We hear a lot about unit, integration, and acceptance
tests.  What is the difference between the three of these. Take 5 minutes and
see what you can find out**

### Write in a notebook

Write your own answers to the following questions. Take 5 minutes, then we'll
discuss as a group.

1) Why do we test?

2) Who benefits from our testing?

3) When should we test?

4) When do we not need to test?

### Getting started

Let's continue working on the ideabox app we built together in class yesterday: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/ideabox-react

### Running Tests

As we mentioned before, `create-react-app` has a built in testing framework that
cannot be changed without ejecting from the boilerplate. Luckily, it's a pretty
awesome test runner called `Jest`. [Read more about the Jest and React combo
here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html).

In order to run the tests, type `npm test`. Normally, our suite runs and then we
return to the command line. With Create React App, `npm test` starts up a server
that is constantly watching for changes. When you modify a file, the test suite
will automatically rerun. Even better â€” by default, it will only watch files
that have changed since the last time you made a git commit.

Try it out - run `npm test` to fire up the testing server. Currently our app has
only one test file, `App.test.js`. Take a few seconds to look at that file.

**Stop and Read**: [This section on file naming
conventions](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/docusaurus/docs/running-tests.md#filename-conventions).  

Traditionally, we have always put our tests into their own directory. That is
absolutely still possible, but the Facebook team makes some good points for
keeping test files in the same directory as their implementation. Whatever you
decide to do in the future is up to you, but let's go with the facebook
convention for the purposes of this tutorial.  

Jest is great for unit testing your app, but according to the [react docs on
testing](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/docusaurus/docs/running-tests.md)
they "recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you
need them. They are beyond the scope of Create React App." This means
implementing our super friend `Enzyme`!  

### Setting up Enzyme

Enzyme is a fantasic tool for testing our React components in a virtual way,
without actually having to use a browser. This makes running tests related to
our UI much faster. First off, let's get Enzyme installed:

```bash 
npm install enzyme --save-dev 
```

You're also going need the enzyme adapter for the version of React that you're
using. As of this writing, it's enzyme-adapter-react-16, but that will change in
the future, when create-react-app starts using version 17 of React. Just make
sure you have the right one.

```bash 
npm install enzyme-adapter-react-16 --save-dev 
```

As a last step, we need to make sure that the adapter is configured before our
test suite runs. Setting up some kind of configuration before a test suite runs
is a really common task actually. So common in fact, that the create-react-app
team has a specific way you need to do this.

Inside of `src/`, create a file called `setupTests.js`.

Jest will run this file before your test suite starts up, so it's the ideal
place to do any kind of configuration or setup for the test suite. Add the
following to `setupTests.js`:

```js 
// src/setupTests.js

import { configure } from 'enzyme'; 
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';

configure({ adapter: new Adapter() }); 
``` 

**Note** be sure to restart your test
runner after adding this configuration, otherwise it won't take effect.

Great! Now we're all ready to start using Enzyme to test our React components!

### Testing the Card Component

First, we'll have to create a test file called `Card.test.js`. In `Card.test.js`, we'll start with a simple test to see if the `name`
property is properly rendered in the component when passed in as a prop.

```jsx 
import React from 'react'; 
import { shallow, mount } from 'enzyme';
import Card from './Card';

describe('Card', () => {
  it('renders the title of the idea in <h1> tags', () => { 
    const wrapper = shallow(<Card title="Bananas" />); 
    const title = <h1>Bananas</h1>;

    expect(wrapper.contains(title)).toEqual(true); 
  });
}); 
```

As previously mentioned, `create-react-app` uses
[Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) instead of Mocha. That said, you'll
notice that the syntax is surprising similar. One difference is that Jest
includes its own expectation library which is similar to Chai's `expect` syntax
(as opposed to the `assert` syntax).  

[Jest Assertions](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html)  

If you run `npm test` you should see your one test pass (two if you still have
the generic App test). You can keep this process running. The test suite will
automatically run whenever you make a change to the test file.

This test works, but you might be thinking right now, 'hey don't my PropTypes
cover that kind of behavior?' You're absolutely right! If you're using PropTypes
throughout your application you really don't need these kinds of tests. In fact,
there is a much simpler way of testing your UI, snapshot tests!

### Snapshot testing

The first thing to realize is that snap shot tests are not really TDD. Instead,
we use snapshot tests to compare against a previous 'snapshot' of what our
component looked like. If something has changed, the snapshot will fail. Then,
if we've expected that change, we can `update` our snapshot to use the newest
version. Add the following test:

```jsx 
import React from 'react'; 
import { shallow, mount } from 'enzyme';
import Card from './Card';

describe('Card', () => { 
  it('should match the snapshot with all data passed in correctly', () => { 
    const wrapper = shallow( <Card 
      title="Bananas"
      body="B A N A N A S" 
      removeIdea={jest.fn()} 
    />);

    expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot(); 
  }); 
}); 
```

Go ahead and run this test. It passes, and you should see the line `1 snapshot
created`

Ok, well that's great, but what are we actually testing? The first time we run
the snapshot test, it doesn't have anything to compare against, so it records
the snapshot, and puts it in a new directory `__snapshots__/` next to wherever
your test lives. Go ahead and look at this now.

How do we make this test fail? We'd have to change what our component actually
looks like. Do that now:

```jsx 
// Card.js
...
describe('Card', () => { 
  it('should match the snapshot with all data passed in correctly', () => { 
    const wrapper = shallow( <Card 
      title="Bananas"
      body="B A N A N A S" 
      onDelete={jest.fn()} 
    />);

    expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot(); 
  }); 
}); 

  
```

Running the tests now, you should see a failure for the snapshot test, with the
differences between the two snapshots in the console. Here is where you have to
consider, 'am I ok with those changes?' If so, you can update the tests by
typing `u` while `Jest` is still in watch mode. Alternatively, you can restart
your test suite and run `npm test --updateSnapshot`.

### Testing for dynamic changes  

When you're testing your components, you're mainly testing presentation logic.
Given our UI will change based on application data (our component props), we'll
want to make sure we have tests for any conditional logic or dynamic changes.
For example, our grocery component changes visually based on whether or not the
grocery item has been starred or purchased. 

We could start out with a simple test to see if a card has the appropriate class if
it's starred.

```jsx 
it('should have a className of "favorite" if isFavorite', () => { const
  wrapper = shallow( <Card title="Bananas" isFavorite={true} />);

  expect(wrapper.is('.favorite')).toEqual(true); 
}); 
```

This will fail. To fix it, we need to set up a property and a conditional within our component
that checks if the property `favorite` has been passed in as a prop. Let's be
fancy and use conditional rendering in a template literal in `Card.js`.

```jsx 
<div className={`Card ${ isFavorite && 'favorite' }`}> 
```

### Testing Button Functionality

We currently only have one button, but how do we know it's doing what we expect
it to?

First, we should start by being clear about what should happen. If you look
closely at the code, you'll see that the `removeIdea`
property is being passed in. It stands to reason that this function should
be called when that button is tested.

At this point, we don't necessarily care what the functions are doing -- just
that they are being called appropriately. This is where **mocks** come in handy.
Mocks are stubbed-in or "faked" functionality that allows us to unit test
specific parts of our code without having to worry about others. A mock will
override the behavior of a specific function and provide you with utilities to
test the interaction with the mock instead.

You'll find when testing applications that use a framework like React, you'll
need to make a significant amount of mocks. And that's ok! Sometimes it may feel
like you're faking too much of your code by mocking so many pieces of
functionality. The general rule here is if you're not testing the actual
behavior **within** the code you are mocking, it's perfectly fine to mock it.

So let's use mocks to test that the removeIdea function we passed in is being called
appropriately.

Consider the following test:

```jsx 
it('should call the removeIdea prop when clicked', () => { 
  const removeIdeaMock = jest.fn();

  const wrapper = mount( 
    <Card 
      title="Bananas" 
      body="blah blah bloop"
      removeIdea={removeIdeaMock} 
    />
  );

  wrapper.find('.btn--remove').simulate('click');

  expect(removeIdeaMock).toBeCalled(); 
}); 
```

- `jest.fn()` returns a special mock function that we can use but also test to
  see if it was called.
- `wrapper.find('.btn-remove').simulate('click');` will simulate a click
  event.
- `expect(removeIdeaMock).toBeCalled()` asks our mock function if it was called.
  Ideally, when we wire it up to the appropriate button, this will be true.
- We are now using the `mount` function to create our wrapper rather than the
  `shallow` rendering we've used previously. Doing a full mount will allow us to
more easily test methods on our components. Read more about the differences
between [shallow
rendering](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/api/shallow.md) and
[full mounting](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/api/mount.md).

#### Your Turn

- What's missing to make the test pass?
- We likely want to pass in an idea id to the `removeIdea`
  method so we can keep track of the idea that needs to be removed. Can you add an
assertion to the previous test to check that the mock was called with
the correct arguments?
([If you need a hint](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html#content))

### Testing a class method

So far, we've only been concerned with the tests for this small, stateless
component. What about testing our class components? How will that differ?

Here, our App is bit more full featured, with two class methods. This first adds
Groceries to our state, and the second gives us a list of JSX elements. What
we'd like to be able to do is test those methods in isolation. Fortunately,
Enzyme has a really handy tool for doing just that, `instance()`.

Calling `instance()` on our wrapper will give us access to all the class'
instance methods, in this case, `addIdea` and `removeIdea`. Let's write a
test for `addIdea`.

```jsx 
// App.test.js

describe('App', () => { 
  it('should update state with an idea when addIdea is called', () => { 
    // Setup 
    const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
    const mockIdea = { title: 'sweaters for pugs', body: 'why not?' }; 
    const expected = [{title: 'sweater for pugs', body: 'why not?'}];

    // Execution 
    wrapper.instance().addGrocery(mockGrocery);

    // Expectation 
    expect(wrapper.state('groceries')).toEqual(expected);
  });
});
```

### Homework: Finish testing your ideabox

- Write a unit test for removeIdea
- Can you write the tests and implementation for the "favorite" button (that
  doesn't exist yet)?
- Write a test that makes sure that our IdeasContainer shows the correct number
  of ideas.
- Make sure that any other functions or interactions (ie. button clicks) are
  tested.
- Not shown: Can you test and implement a counter that keeps track of the number
  of ideas in the list?
