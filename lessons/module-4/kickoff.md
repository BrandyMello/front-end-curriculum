title: Module 4 KickOff
---

## Learning Goals & Focus

### Week 1: Server-Side Intro

Learning technologies like Node and Express will round out your skill set and make you a more flexible developer. Front-end developers still need a solid understanding of how to work with the back-end in order to be successful.

**Palette Picker:** Your first server-side challenge. You'll build an API that holds data in a persistent database. You'll also make a front-end (with jQuery) to interact with your API.

### Week 2: Server-Side Reinforcement and Advanced Topics

You'll take what you learned during week 1 and expand on it. You'll learn how to deal with development in multiple environments, server-side testing, continuous integration, and also experiment with webscraping.

Week 2 will also be a time when we start giving code challenges to prepare you for interviewing.

**BYOB BE:** Build an API with full "CRUD" functionality that is fully tested. It will also use continuous integration for automatic deployment.

### Week 3: More Advanced FE - Mobile Dev & Progressive Web Apps

This module, we'll introduce some of the current technologies being used for creating mobile applications. This includes libraries like React Native, and **Progressive Web Apps** (PWAs) that use Web APIs like service workers, background sync, and push notifications.

**BYOB FE:** Using your BYOB back-end API, you will create a front-end to connect to the API and display the data. You'll also add some PWA technologies to your front-end.

### Weeks 4 & 5: Reinforcement of Fundamentals, Interview Prep & Cross-Pollination

We'll be providing a ton of small, interview-style challenges throughout these two weeks that will reinforce fundamental skills and refresh some of the previous content you learned (everyone seems to forget how to write a class from memory...). 

_All of the questions and challenges we give you are taken from interviews given to graduates._

And then there's your last group project! You'll get a chance to work with back-end teammates to create something really special. We encourage you to take risks with new technologies, show off your skills, and make something to wow the judges at demo night.

### Week 6: Final Assessment and Graduation

Your final assessment will be a take-home style challenge that you will work on independently (we'll talk about this more as the weeks go on).

Everyone will also need to complete a successful mock interview.

## Graduation Requirements

In order to graduate from Module 4, students must complete each of the following:

### 90% Attendance

Students must notify instructors of any absences, and are required to make up any work missed during the time they were out. 
If missing class for an interview, students must record the interview questions they received and add them to this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PPfnfGOmzVRPXVa9t9qzl1G6vYM52teL7NksRQbfqiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

### Final Assessment

This will be week 6. The assessment will be similar to a take-home challenge you could see for an interview. Students must earn a score of `3` or greater in *each* category of the final assessment rubric.

### Mock Interview

Students must do a mock interview with one of the instructors. You will be given feedback on technical accuracy, eloquence, and professionalism (style and grace).

### Independent Work

* Prework Assignments
* Palette Picker

### Group Work

* Build-Your-Own-Backend (BE and FE)
* Cross-Pollination Project

### Career Development

The Career Development segment is made up of a 30-day action plan where you will work with your cohort mates and instructors to prepare yourself for moving on after Turing. 
This will be mentioned again during your week-one professional development kickoff, but you can see a general outline of the 30-day action plan [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md)

### Portfolio Presentation

On the final Thursday of the module, you will give a 10-minute presentation about your experience in module 4, Turing, and your action plan going forward. 
The details about it can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios/blob/master/README.markdown) under "Module 4 (Front-End)".
