title: Module 4 KickOff
---

## Learning Goals & Focus

### Week 1: Server-Side Skills

Learning technologies like node and express will round out your skill set and make you a more flexible developer. 
Front-end developers still need a solid understanding of how to work with the back-end in order to be successful.

### Week 2: Mobile Dev & Progressive Web Apps

This module will introduce some of the current technologies being used for creating mobile applications. 
This includes libraries like React Native, and Web APIs like service workers, background sync and push notifications.

### Week 3: Security

We'll be talking about security at a high-level and implementing some strategies for making our applications more secure. 
This includes protecting endpoints with JSON web tokens, understanding the difference between HTTP and HTTPS, and implementing OAuth.

### Week 4-6: Reinforcement of Fundamentals, Real-World Topics, & Interview Prep

We'll be moving away from boilerplates and frameworks in this module to get you used to building things from scratch again. 
We'll be providing smaller challenges throughout the module that will reinforce fundamental skills and refresh some of the previous content you learned. 
Many of these challenges will better prepare you for the technical interviews you'll be going on.


## Graduation Requirements

In order to graduate from Module 4, students must complete each of the following:

### 90% Attendance

Students must notify instructors of any absences, and are required to make up any work missed during the time they were out.

### Career Development

The Career Development segment is made up of a 30-day action plan where you will work with your cohort mates and instructors to prepare yourself for moving on after Turing. 
This will be mentioned again during your week one professional development kickoff, but you can see a general outline [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md)

### Portfolio Presentation

On the final Thursday of the module, you will give a 10-minute presentation about your experience in module 4, Turing, and your action plan going forward. 
The details about it can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios/blob/master/README.markdown) under "Module 4 (Front-End)".
