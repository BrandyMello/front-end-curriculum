## Goals

* Understand what it's like to be an interviewer and interviewee
* More practice with small code challenges

## Intro - Why?

A common interview practice is a pair-programming session between you and a mid-senior level developer at that company. 
They want to see what your JavaScript skills look like as well as how you interact, pair with others, and get a glimpse at your thought process.

In this session, you'll get to know a little more what it's like to be in a pair programming situation as an interviewer _and_ interviewee.

(This exercise assumes that you have worked on an exercism in the past.)

### General Outline

1. Each partner picks an exercism to solve on their own
2. Work on the exercism by yourself
3. One partner is interviewer and gives their exercism challenge to their partner (the interviewee)
4. Debrief
5. Switch interviewer and interviewee roles
6. Final debrief

## Pair Up

Pair up with someone in the class - someone that you haven't worked with this module.

Each person in your group, go to this [JavaScript exercism list](http://exercism.io/languages/javascript/exercises) and each choose a different exercism 
(that both of you have not solved before).

## Work Individually

(45 minutes)

Work on solving the exercism you chose. Each partner works individually on their own problem - do not share your work or solution with your partner.

## Interviewer and Interviewee

(45 minutes)

One person from each group raise your hand.

Congratulations! You are the interviewer for this first round (don't worry, the other partner in the group will eventually be the interviewer too).

As the interviewer, you give the exercism that you worked on as the interview challenge. The other partner, as the interviewee, works to solve the 
problem in front of the interviewer.

### Roles

Things to check off for your role:

**Interviewer**

* If your interviewee finishes ahead of time, ask them to refactor or approach the problem in a different way

**Interviewee**

* Talk aloud about your process

Here is a script that you should start out with:

**Interviewer:** Hello
**Interviewee:** Hello

## Debrief

What was it like?? Take 3 minutes to write in your notebook what it was like as the interviewer or interviewee.

As the interviewer, what is some constructive criticism you could give to your interviewee? Write them down to share with that person later in the lesson.
As the interviewee, what were some specific things you thought went well and did not go so well? Write them down in your notebook.

**Share out:** What were your general observations as the interviewer or the interviewee?

<!-- Some issues they should talk about: -->
<!-- * Talk aloud through the problem so that the interviewer can know you read through everything -->
<!-- * Ask any clarifying questions or any questions about assumptions made for the problem -->
<!-- * It's ok to draw something on paper first or pseudocode -->
<!-- * Talk it out (silence is deafening in an interview pairing situation). The interviewer wants to know what your thinking and what your thought process is like -->

## Switch!

Reverse the roles! (45 minutes)

## Debrief and Closing Thoughts

As the interviewer, what is some constructive criticism you could give to your interviewee? Write them down in your notebook.
As the interviewee, what were some specific things you thought went well and did not go so well? Write them down in your notebook.

Share out: Any other observations?

Are you more or less confident about interview code pairings?
