    <h4>The expectation is still 90% attendance</h4>
    <p>If you have an appointment or interview, then you need to let us know the day before.</p>
    <p>Instructors respect your time for job hunting in mod4, but you still need to be professional about it. Unexcused absences and tardiness will be recorded.</p>
