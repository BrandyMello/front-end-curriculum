### Setting the Scene

Imagine you're a hiring manager - I know, you wish right now! You have a few candidates that sent you their repositories, and you have to make a judgment call on who to bring in based on their repository REAMDEs. Note: this actually happens!

Who do you bring in for the interview? How do you decide?


## Who do You Interview?

Break up into groups of three, and get a piece of chart paper with a marker.

### The Candidates

Here is a set of repositories, each representing a candidate:

* [School Finder](https://github.com/sljohnson32/school-finder)
* [Flex Sandbox](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/flex-sandbox)
* [Narwhal Assault](https://github.com/Obleo33/game-time)
* [Poker Season Tracker](https://github.com/notmarkmiranda/poker_season_tracker) <!-- medium, image is not working, all text... -->
* [Club Reads](https://github.com/lindsaywparker/club-reads-frontend) <!-- high, text needs some formatting help, but pretty good -->

You have 20 minutes to go through these repositories and determine who you want to bring in for the interview.

On your chart paper, you should write about what you looked for in the READMEs. What should every README have? What stood out about good READMEs?

### The Decision

Bring your chart papers to the front of the class, and let's talk about commonalities we find between them.

Who do you bring in for the interview? Why?


## Self Assessment and Planning

Take 5-10 minutes to look through your GitHub profile, identify repositories you want to showcase, and look at your own READMEs.

Where do you need to improve? What things about successful READMEs that we identified have you already implemented?

### Work Time

1. Decide the top repos that you want to showcase (6 as a maximum)
1. Pin them to your GitHub profile
1. Identify 

### Share Out

What other things about repositories should be taken into consideration beside the README?
