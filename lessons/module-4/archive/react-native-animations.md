## Animating Like a Boss

What is new is dealing with iOS and Android. For the most part you can write a most of your code that is used by both. But know that there will be differences in some UI components that you use, the process for emulating devices will be different and there will be performance differences between the two (if it runs fast on Android, it should be blazing fast on iOS).



Let's grab Animatable:

```js
$ npm install react-native-animatable --save
`
