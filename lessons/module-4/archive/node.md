### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will:

* Understand how you might work with back-end developers on your team
* Understand how the client and server relationship works
* Know what a server is and how requests and responses are handled using the Node HTTP library
* Know which appropriate RESTful method to send in a request

## HTTP, REST and Building a Simple Node Server

Even as a front-end developer, it's important to have a basic understanding of what's going on behind the scenes in the back-end. You'll often be working with back-end developers on your team that will have a huge effect on how your application interacts with its data. The better you understand the back-end, the more prepared you'll be to build an application on top of it.

### The Server
A server is simply a computer or program that handles sending, retrieving and manipulating resources for a client. There are many different types of servers, but when we are building web applications, we're most concerned with what's called a **Web Server** or an **HTTP Server**. You'll often hear these two terms used interchangeably, or simply shortened to "server".

An **HTTP Server** handles any network requests by providing responses that can be HTML pages, files, data, etc. For example, when we navigate to [https://www.turing.io/](https://www.turing.io/) in our browser (**Web Client**), we are really making a request to an HTTP server. The server is then responding with all of the HTML needed to render the page. We can even visually see this by looking in the 'Network' tab of our developer tools:

![network requests][network-requests]

The network tab will list any requests you make to the server. If we search for `www.turing.io`, in the top left of the network panel, we can see that the type of request we made was for a `document`. If we click on this request, we can also see information about the request itself, as well as the response we were given. Clicking on the 'Response' tab, you'll see the entire markup of the HTML document we requested:

![network response][network-response]

[network-response]: /assets/images/lessons/backend-primer/network-response.png

#### Making Requests to the Server
Our applications will request HTML documents, CSS files, images, and data. The way each of these requests are made is quite different:

* Typing a URL like `https://www.turing.io` into the browser makes a request for an HTML document
* Including a link tag to request an external stylesheet: `<link href="https://www.turing.io/css/styles.css" />`
* Adding an image element to display a logo: `<img src="https://www.turing.io/images/logo.png" />`.
* Making a fetch request to retrieve data: `fetch('https://www.turing.io/api/v1/curriculum/')`

While the syntax for each of these requests looks significantly different, they all share one thing in common: *Every request we make to an HTTP Server requires a URL.*

![url pic][url-pic]

[url-pic]: /assets/images/lessons/http-rest-node-server/url-pic.gif

When fetching data, you'll often hear the URL referred to as an "endpoint". These endpoints (e.g. `https://www.turing.io/api/v1/curriculum/`) are created by the back-end developers on a team to help the front-end developers access and interact with application data. Just like the front-end, there are many frameworks and libraries that back-end developers will use to to set up a proper HTTP Server with all the necessary endpoints.

*Note on HTTP: It is simply the protocol for transmitting documents across the internet. There are a bunch more (SSH, POP,FTP...) but we will focus on HTTP since it's primarily used for communication between web browsers and web servers. Hypertext is just structured text that uses links (hyperlinks) between other nodes of structured text. The key to HTTP is that it is stateless, the server doesnâ€™t save data between requests.*


### Student Discussion (5 minutes)
With a partner, discuss what it was like to write server-side code. What was unfamiliar to you? What was familiar to you? Were there any limitations in debugging tools that you are used to using, and how did that effect your ability to solve problems?

### Back-End Frameworks
Unlike the front-end, where our main language is JavaScript, the back-end can be built in PHP, Python, Ruby, etc. Developers have built frameworks for building back-ends with each of these languages (CakePHP, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.). So while deciding on a front-end JavaScript framework is more about preference and opinion, your choices for a back-end framework are often limited to the language you choose to write. Whatever language and framework is chosen for the back-end of an application should have little effect on the front-end, as the only interface for communication between the two is requests and responses through URLs.

For the following lessons, we'll focus on using [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [express](http://expressjs.com/) for building a back-end. We will use Node today to create a simple HTTP server with several endpoints.

#### NodeJS
What are the benefits/disadvantages of using Node versus other server technologies?

Awesomeness of Node includes:

* Everything in JS
* Fast, non-blocking code. Wait for your slow operations (file system, database I/O operations)
* Real-time communications with sockets (run on TCP instead of HTTP)
* Not multi-threaded (good for memory)

Disadvantages of Node:

* Lack of libraries (very new ORM package, image processing)
* Frequent changes to Node API
* Gotta deal with async
* Not multi-threaded (bad for computations)

In the past, we've used Node.js to build our client-side applications (think Webpack). We've even used it to spin up development servers to make it easier to develop our client-side applications. We've used Node.js as a tool for development, but we haven't written much for the platform itself. Luckily, given the fact that they both share some common technologies, we're already in possession of a bit of pre-requisite knowledge.

Here are some things we already know:

- JavaScript
- CommonJS module system (`require` and `module.exports`)
- npm
- `package.json`

### Review: The Request-Response Cycle

On your own, draw a diagram of the request-response cycle as you know it. Include the a client, a server, and how they communicate between each other. After a few minutes, we'll go over it.

### Request-Response Cycle: Under the Hood

Here is what a sample GET request looks like to a server:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
```

And this is a sample response that the server generates to send back to the client:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 1354

<html>
<body>
  .
  .
  .
</body>
</html>
```


### Practice: Handling Request in Node.js

We're going to set up a simple Node server for handling a dataset of messages. Each message contains a `user` and a `message` property. Previously you might have worked with the Express framework on the server-side, which has a lot of very helpful functions for getting a server up and running. Today, we will just be using Node to remind ourselves that life is sometimes harder without frameworks - it will also give us an idea of the low-level programming that a server needs to handle requests.

If you don't already have [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), install it now. Postman is a tool we can use to generate custom requests (GET, POST, PATCH, etc.) that we would otherwise not be able to do through the browser alone.

Nodemon will also be helpful. Nodemon is an npm package that will auto-reload your server any time you make changes so you can see them take effect immediately. Without nodemon, you would have to restart your server every time you made a change to your code. You can install nodemon globally with:

```bash
npm i -g nodemon
```

Next, create and cd into a new directory:

```bash
mkdir messages && cd messages
```

Auto-generate a `package.json` file (with default "yes" to each of the standard questions) using:

```bash
npm init --yes
```

#### Requiring Built-In Modules

Node has an intentionally small standard library. The standard library is documented in the [Node API Documentation][apidocs].

[apidocs]: http://nodejs.org/documentation/api/

The standard library modules can be required from any Node program. You do not have to give a relative path of where the module lives on your local machine - all you need to do is require the module using the CommonJS `require` syntax.

Today we'll want to include the HTTP and URL libraries:

``` js
const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');
```

### A Simple HTTP Server

Create a file called `server.js` and require in the libraries we need:

```js
const http = require("http");
const url = require('url');
const server = http.createServer();
```

The built-in `http.createServer` module inherits from `EventEmitter`. This means when we create our server, it can listen and respond to particular events, such as requests:

```js
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('The HTTP server is listening at Port 3000.');
});

server.on('request', (request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  response.write('Hello World\n');
  response.end();
});
```

### Research - On Your Own

Before we run the server and see it in action, take a few minutes to read through the documentation to know more about each of the response functions.

Read through these sections of the Node documentation:

- [response.writeHead](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_writehead_statuscode_statusmessage_headers)
- [response.write](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_write_chunk_encoding_callback)
- [response.end](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_end_data_encoding_callback)

Can you describe in one or two sentences what each of these methods do?

### Run Your Server

When the server receives a request, a "request" event is emitted, and the server responds with a simple HTTP response.

Now run your server in your terminal with: `nodemon server.js`. Using POSTMAN, make a GET request to `localhost:3000` and see what happens. You should see a 'Hello World' response returned.


### Discussion - Your Turn
In small groups, discuss what types of requests and responses you sent and received in your intermission homework. What did your client side code request? How did your server-side code respond to those requests? What kinds of data did you respond with and how was that data consumed?


### The Inner Workings of a Request and a Response

#### Headers
The header of a request or response allow the client and the server to pass additional information to each other. Think of it as metadata that allows a client or server to handle the request properly.

You specify header information as simply a hash of key-value pairs:
`{ "Content-Type": "text-html" }`

There is a lot of metadata that you can pass in a request. A common header is "Accept", which allows you to set what media types are acceptable and in what quality. Example:

```
 Accept: audio/*; q=0.2, audio/basic

 This should be interpreted as "I prefer audio/basic, but send me any audio type if it is the best available after an 80% mark-down in quality."
```

Another common header is "Content-Length". This indicates the length of the body if the request would have been sent in a GET method. It's measured in bytes - a good way to know quickly how big a request is.

If we look at a response in our browser, we can check out the headers:
![network header][network-header]

[network-header]: /assets/images/lessons/http-rest-node-server/network-header.png

There is a lot of information in the headers, but the one of the most important parts is the status code returned to the client. This tells us what happened to our request. Check out [https://www.w3.org](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) to see all of the status codes for HTTP 1.1, but the general rules are:

* 200 range means everything is OK, the request was successful
* 300 range means you are probably being redirected
* 400 range means you sent a bad request. Do it again, but better
* 500 range means that something is screwed up with the server (thanks back-end...) but my request is OK

#### Body
Requests and responses also might have a body. For example, when you make a `PATCH` request to update a resource, your `fetch` call might look like this:

```js
fetch('/api/v1/books', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    'title': 'The Gene: An Intimate History',
    'author': 'Siddhartha Mukherjee'
  })
});
```

This is an example of sending a body with your request so that the server can parse the data in it and update a resource based on the resulting body object. When the resource is successfully updated, the server will send a response with a status code of `200`, and usually a body object that contains the entire resource, reflecting the new changes that were just made:

```js
// response body
{
  'title': 'The Gene: An Intimate History',
  'author': 'Siddhartha Mukherjee',
  'isbn': '978-1476733524',
  'published': '2015'
}
```

## RESTful API design

REST stands for representational state transfer. This means that web resources communicate using a set of stateless, uniform operations.

The six architectural constraints of REST are:

1. Client-server - Separation of GUI and data
2. Stateless - No client context is stored by server, each client request provides all the information to fulfill the request.
3. Cacheable - Server responses are defined as cacheable or not. (Speeds up future interactions)
4. Layered system - Modularity, each 'layer' serves only a single high-level purpose - multiple servers can handle steps of a request (data/authentication), but the user cannot tell that their request/response went through multiple servers
5. Code on demand - (i.e. instead of just JSON or XML, return JS script tag within HTML document) - optional feature; can still be considered RESTful without this
6. Uniform interface - Ability to identify resources and manipulate them based on standard information provided 

RESTful architecture includes sending HTTP methods to a URL to get back information from a request. This is the implementation of that 'uniform interface' constraint. The primary methods, which are often called CRUD methods (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) are as follows:

1. GET - Retrieve information identified by the request
2. POST - Create a new resource
3. PUT - Fully update a specific resource in its entirety
4. PATCH - Update only a portion of a specific resource
5. DELETE - Destroy an entire specific resource by the request


### Practice: Handling Multiple Requests in Node.js

Now let's make our server a bit more useful. First we'll want to set up some initial messages in our server file to interact with:

```js
let messages = [
  { 'id': 1, 'user': 'brittany storoz', 'message': 'hi there!' },
  { 'id': 2, 'user': 'bob loblaw', 'message': 'check out my law blog' },
  { 'id': 3, 'user': 'lorem ipsum', 'message': 'dolor set amet' }
];
```

And we'll edit our request handler to handle the RESTful HTTP methods: GET and POST.

```js
server.on('request', (request, response) => {
  if (request.method === 'GET') {
    getAllMessages(response);
  }

  else if (request.method === 'POST') {
    let newMessage = { 'id': new Date() };

    request.on('data', (data) => {
      newMessage = Object.assign(newMessage, JSON.parse(data));
    });

    request.on('end', () => {
      addMessage(newMessage, response);
    });
  }
});
```

Given the new functions we're calling (`getAllMessages` and `addMessage`), try to create these functions and have them send an appropriate response back to the client.

### Student Discussion (10 minutes)
Go back to the 6 architectural constraints of a RESTful API and try to identify and articulate how your ChatBox server adheres to each one.
