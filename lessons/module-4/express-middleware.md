## Goals

To be able to create middleware functions and apply them to your Express server endpoints.

The specific purpose of the middleware functions in this lesson is not important, but it is important to know how to implement 
middleware functions and what implications they have on your server endpoints.

### Getting Started

Clone down [this repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/express-middleware-exercise), run `npm install`, and start the 
server to make sure it is set up correctly. You should see something like this in your terminal:

```bash
Middleware exercise server running on http://localhost:3000
```

### Finish the Endpoints
