  <h2>Background Sync & Push Notifications</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Goals:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Understand how background sync works with Service Workers to queue network requests</li>
    <li>Be able to implement push notifications when a sync event is complete</li> 
  </ol>

    <h3>Background Sync</h3>
  </section>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>allows us to defer an action to a later point in time when a user has a more stable network connection</li>
      <li>is an API dependent on Service Workers</li>
      <li>allows us to run code on a separate thread that will not lock up or interfere with any other client-side javascript</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Push Notifications</h3>
  </section>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>enables us to send notifications outside the context of a browser page</li>
      <li>mimics the notification functionality we're familiar with on our phones and devices</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

<section>
  <h3>When Do I Use These?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>when a user is manipulating application data through network requests but has an unstable or intermittent connection</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Let's Practice</h3>
  <p>Fetch and checkout the 'before-sync-lesson' branch of the <a href="https://github.com/turingschool-examples/offline-news">offline news repo</a></p>
  <p><pre><code>`npm install`</code></pre></p>
  <p><pre><code>`webpack --watch`</code></pre></p>
  <p><pre><code>`node server.js`</code></pre></p>
  <p><pre><code>`http://localhost:3000`</code></pre></p>

  <h3>What's New?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added a tiny form so that any bozo can add their own news</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>What Are Our Goals?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Set up communication between our client-side code and our service worker</li>
    <li>Service worker intercepts POST request and waits for network connectivity before completing</li>
    <li>Upon completion, SW sends a message to the client to update the DOM</li>
    <li>Upon completion, SW sends a push notification to notify users it is complete</li>
  </ul>
