On October 11th, 2016 - we asked the following question to the Turing Mentors channel

```
My front end students wanted me to ask you all:

a. How do you feel about Angular (as opposed to other front end frameworks)

b. They’ve heard that the newest version of Angular is ‘hated’ - why is that?

I know this is a contentious topic so I’d love to compile and share with them the opinions of people who work with front end frameworks day to day - in addition to me saying ‘it’s a whole thing’
```

The answers we got back were excellent - so here they are!

> Anecdotally... angular is/was going through a rough 1.0 -> 2.0 transition which fractured bits of the community. That is scary to me from a longevity & learning standpoint. Beyond this, it's complex and has potential non-intuitive semantics around the directives stuff. I've heard of people hitting performance issues w/ angular and while saying that directives were complicated. I don't know if those are correlated, though. Again, all second-hand anecdotal.

> No experience with Angular, but the pink 34% in the first chart here is…unnerving. http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/
> looks like 2.0 is less disliked so far.

- Justin Crawford

> Just threw away 3-4 months of angular work to go back to rails - we're happier and faster now :smiley:
> I'm a ruby guy but I thought people felt better about angular2? It's down to 1 way data binding and I hear good things about typescript

- Rick Rein

> I feel like there are better options than Angular 1 at this point. It was slow and hard to code (in my opinion). React has blown up, Vue has begun to grow, and Angular 2 has launched. There is still a ton of legacy Angular 1, so it might be good to learn (from a job perspective). Learning how to transition from Angular 1 -> React, Angular 2, etc might be an awesome thing to dig into

> the breakdown is like this: ember/angular, pick one and know it. You know that quote about every decently sized sintra app is like a poorly implemented half baked rails app? same applies here. Use these tools to build architecture. react: yep, know it, its the new backbone. kinda like sinatra, pretty lightweight, good support, but you have to make choices about the state management, the api protocol, the router, etc. its a jack of all trades, but just like any technology, not always the best choice. vanilla js, yep, know this too, sometimes having a framework doesn't pay. maybe its a mobile specific/optimized site, etc. if you know something in these 3 types of js frontend tech, you’ll be flexible enough to move between them and have a feeling for which tool to pick for the job.

> I’d personally focus less on trying to figure out the differences between angular 1 and 2, for example, and more on the architectural decisions behind the frameworks and a general feeling for the workflow cycle between different tech stack choices. afterall, its all just javascript :slightly_smiling_face:

> I've been using Angular 2 for the past 6 months and I love it (granted I have no Angular 1 experience) In my opinion, people who "hate" it are probably just bitter about the fact that so much has changed from Angular 1.
