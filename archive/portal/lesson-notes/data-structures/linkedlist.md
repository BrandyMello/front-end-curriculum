## Notes from 1608

# Linked List Lesson

## Intro Talk

#### Why Teach Data Structures and Algorithms?

- QL - 1st job - **'mepson'** printers
- Working in **Angular and Node** (I barely knew fundamental JS) - **Machine code of the printer** itself
- **Lost at sea** - took me a full week to even feel like I could run all the code on my own
- But I got there eventually.
- However, **my best contribution** - which saved the client **more $** than anyone else on my team - came at a dev team meeting
- Going over the **final comps**-
- **Hey guys**, has anyone here ever actually put together an expense report from receipts?
- No one had, so no one realized - can't just assume **every line item from a receipt will go towards one project**
  - Often order bulk on parts and split between jobs
  - Or, dude with a credit card 'accidently' buys a stick of gum
- Because I was the only one on our dev team who hadn't been a dev for their entire career - **I could point this out**.
- After that meeting, **reworked the entire design.**
- Changed product from being pretty but unusable w/o wasting dev hours.

**We bring our past careers and knowledge and experiences**

And we're not afraid to learn new things and ask for help.

### Turing Grads are generally better employees than fresh CSS grads

1 place we struggle is ***speaking towards historically CS heavy topics*** like data structures and algorithms. 

The thing is, data structures and algos sound more scary than they are.

Everyone in this room technically knows what Linked List is, we just might not know off the top of our heads what the vocab is.

### Goal of these Friday sessions is to:

- ***demystify these concepts***
- ***enforce some good pairing practices***
- ***share knowledge accross programs***

Basically, if someone in an interview asks you what a linked list is - I want you to be able to answer that question and get it out of the way, so you can talk about the things you are passionate about in what you do. 

Where 2 mods coming from

We will be talking for a bit about a data structure - then pairing you off to work on it.

### Define a Linked List

- Drop Link to Repo

- Open README

### What is a Linked List?

- Linked List one of the most fundamental Computer Science data structures
  - A way to structure data
  - A Data Structure
  - Ahem.

'In a singly-linked list you have a head, the start of the list, and nodes which hold the data. Each node holds a single element of data and a link to the next node in the list.'

There are a few analogies we can use to describe a Linked List.

First One - *** Carmen Sandiego/Scavenger Hunt *** - http://www.aux.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Carmen-Sandiego-613x307.jpg

Anyone remember the game? You were trying to find Carmen Sandiego - kept going to locations and then you would find someone who would give you the clues for the next location.

- Scavenger Hunt
  - Turing Had It
  - Administration was hard 
- We don't have a scavenger hunt at Turing anymore... but we do have our Friday schedule
- Pull up spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yDIx8DlD6XUGFOSmq1j6t4b3e26bn2wD2Nu7E-cp7q4/edit#gid=0

- So in a typical scavenger hunt - you would arrive at Blakement at 9:00am
  - At Blakement you would find a piece of crumpled paper that told you to go to _____ - _etc etc_

- The way this schedule is stored is like an Array. 

- Can see the difference when I need to remove a location
    - In excel, just delete a column - array - the list depends on order only
    - In the actual hunt, you have to go to the location - remove the clue and move it to the previous location (Linked List: a clue in each location)
    
If I remove Kyle and forget to update the link or scavenger hunt paper, you'll never go home

And that's what happened at the Turing scavenger hunt. We literally did have someone quit the program.
    
### Why use a Linked List over an Array

Restaurant Analogy

(Array: Relies on a huge section of code or space) - Order matters in an array

Imagine you have a family reunion and you all want to go to the Cheesecake factory

You'll have to wait a long time to get 20 people all seated together - You'll also spend, like, 20 minutes when you do get a table trying to get the order of who sits near whom correct. Avoid Uncle Bob.

If you family was like a linked list - you would have a phone number for one relative. You could sit anywhere in the restaurant. And just play the telephone game and group text. 

When the computer allocated memory to a data structure, if memory is an issue (such as on a rasperry pi for example) - you may not be able to find the space to store an array all in one place. But you will be able to spread a linked list out.

## Get Into Programming

- Open test suite 

- Walk through how test suite works - links to the js files in the html
  
- Get the first two tests a passin'

- Take Attendance
  
- Generate groups

- 1st Pomo - Ping Pong rules or Driver/Conductor

- 2nd Pomo - Break - Prompt 'Your favorite project at Turing or otherwise that you've worked on'
