  <h2 id="before">Prework Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Prework provides important context, vocabulary, and a baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on day one. Students who invest time in familiarizing themselves with key concepts maximize their success and confidence in the early weeks with us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Your prework is due the Monday before classes begin. You will use <a href="https://sites.google.com/casimircreative.com/enrollment/pre-work?authuser=0" target="_blank">this site's Google form</a> to submit your prework when you are finished.</b>

  <h3>What is Front-End Development?</h3>
  <p>
    Front-end development deals with the user facing elements of a website, or the part of the website or software that you interact with. It's the meeting point of design and development, and requires developers to be skilled at writing a blend of HTML (page structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity). Using UX/UI principles, expert understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, front-end developers are a critical part of modern software engineering teams.

  <h3>Learning Goals</h3>
  <p>The prework is organized across seven days. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort to complete the tasks for each day - so about 30-35 hours total. Goals of the prework:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish a routine of coding every day</li>
    <li>Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Sublime Text, Chrome, the console, and the command line)</li>
    <li>Understand what pieces make up a web application</li>
    <li>Become familiar with some common terminology used in web development</li>
    <li>Develop a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in order to build a simple, static web page (for show and tell!)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have more than seven days (or more than 30-35 hours) to dedicate to prework, first complete the 7-day prework tasks, and then continue to the <a href="#month">month-long prework section</a> that contains additional resources on multiple subjects to serve as a deeper dive.</p>
  <p>Remember, don't worry if you don't understand 100% of everything. Let's get started!</p>

<article>
  <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
  <p>Items you need to complete the prework:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A computer - preferably a laptop running Mac OSX that is a 2013 model or newer. If you have a Windows, Linux PC or an older Mac, then go ahead and still do this prework!</li>
    <li>Purchase the book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1459879147&sr=8-3&keywords=duckett" target="_blank">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a></li>
    <li>Purchase the book or use the online PDF: <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming</a></li>
    <li>A consistent internet connection</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prework Assignments</h2>

  <article id="week">
    <h3 id="daily">Daily Warm Up</h3>
    <p>Practice makes perfect, and this daily task will help build on your typing skills. Spend 20 minutes total on this every-day task.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4><a href="https://typing.io/" target="_blank">typing.io</a></h4>
        <p>Aim for 25 wpm without looking at the keyboard. Focus on JavaScript and jQuery. You would be surprised how many common programming keyboard characters you're not used to typing.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Weeklong Ramp-Up</h3>
    <p>At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This 7 days of prework is desgined to get you into that essential routine before the first day of class.</p>
    <p>Even if you plan to spend 14 days on this 7-day prework, you should break up the work so that you are doing work and coding every day, even if it is only a little.</p>

      <ul class="expander-content" hidden>
        <li>
          <h4>Mac OS Introduction</h4>
          <p>If this is your first time using a Mac instead of a PC or Linux, then watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN0FD8KW2V4" target="_blank">this video</a> about the basics of using a Mac.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Daily Warm Up</h4>
          <p>Work through <a href="https://typing.io/" target="_blank">typing.io</a> as described in <a href="#daily">Daily Warm Up</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Computer Setup</h4>
          <p>Before you start going through material on HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, you'll need to get your system set up. Install these programs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4 class="full-width"><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Install the Sublime Text editor</a></h4>
              <p>Sublime Text is a program where we edit code - it is a free text editor with many great features that makes editing code more enjoyable compared to a simple text editor. Sublime Text is commonly used in the software development industry, and you will use it throughout your time at Turing. It is a free program, but it will ask you periodically to make a donation - you can just decline and keep using Sublime Text for free.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="full-width"><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html" target="_blank">Install Google Chrome Canary</a></h4>
              <p>Google Chrome Canary is a bleeding edge, experimental version of Chrome, with the latest features. This web browser is great for general internet perusing, but web developers like it because it has very useful developer tools (the console), which you will use in the prework and extensively during class.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Install Xcode</h4>
              <p>Xcode is a huge suite of development tools published by Apple. If we wanted to develop software for the Apple Ecosystem (iPhone apps, macOS apps, etc), we would use Xcode as our editor. But even if we aren’t working in this ecosystem, Xcode provides some system dependencies that we’ll want to have available.</p>
              <p>Download and install Xcode from the Apple App Store - this will probably take a little while to finish. Go get some coffee and eat breakfast...</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Start a Gist to Track Your Technical Prework Progress</h4>
          <p>A gist is basically a file where you can add text, and the gist file is tied to your GitHub account. Here is some documentation about <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/" target="_blank">how to create a gist</a>.</p>
          <p>Sign in to GitHub. From your GitHub account, create a public gist with the filename that includes the word "prework" and your name. Something like: <code>JimSmith_Prework.md</code></p>
          <p>The <code>.md</code> file extension for your gist refers to markdown formatting. Markdown is a simple markup language to help format your text. For example, you can add a heading in markdown using the hash: <code># This is my main title</code>. <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">This article</a> shows everything you need for basic markdown formatting.</p>
          <p>You should put all of the answers to questions asked in the prework in this new gist. Every time you work on more prework, track your progress by adding to this gist.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Create a <a href="https://codepen.io" target="_blank">CodePen</a> Account</h4>
          <p>CodePen is a website where you can quickly create small projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is lightweight, and you can see the output of your code right away!</p>
          <p>In order to save your CodePen projects, you need to have an account. It's free - you just have to sign up!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Read Chapters 1 and 2 on Structure and Text from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1459879147&sr=8-3&keywords=duckett" target="_blank">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a></h4>
          <p>Open the prework gist you created earlier, and answer these questions about the reading in your gist:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?</li>
            <li>What is the difference between an element and a tag?</li>
            <li>Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?</li>
            <li>Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.</li>
            <li>In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?</li>
            <li>List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <code>&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</code> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.</li>
            <li>What are empty elements?</li>
            <li>What is semantic markup?</li>
            <li>What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Go to <a href="https://codepen.io" target="_blank">CodePen</a>. Create a new "pen", and start to write some HTML code in CodePen using what you read from the Structure and Text chapters. The HTML should include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The basic HTML structure (body, title, head, etc.).</li>
            <li>At least two levels of headings.</li>
            <li>Multiple paragraphs.</li>
            <li>The paragraph text should be about what drives you to learn about web development.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When you are done, save the "pen", and paste the link into your prework gist. You're doing it! You're starting the beginning of your web development career.</p>
          <p>Some resources about using CodePen:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_k03JH3b24" target="_blank">Here is a video</a> about the basics of CodePen and how to use it.</li>
            <li>Step through <a href="https://codepen.io/pen/tour/welcome/start">this interactive walkthrough</a> to familiarize yourself with using CodePen.</li>
            <li>If you're stuck on what a basic HTML structure looks like, use page 58 in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1459879147&sr=8-3&keywords=duckett" target="_blank">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a> to help get you started.</li>

          <h4>Read Chapters 1 and 2 (Data Types, Variables, and Control Flow) from <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming</a></h4>
          <p>Answer these questions about the reading in your prework gist:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.</li>
            <li>What are the three logical operators that JavaScript supports?</li>
            <li>What is the naming convention used for variables?</li>
            <li>What is the difference between an expression and a statement?</li>
            <li>What are a few JavaScript reserved words, and why are they important to avoid using them for variable names?</li>
            <li>What is control flow, and why is it useful for programming?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Open up the Chrome Developer Tools, and open the Console tab. This is where we can write some JavaScript! If you don't remember how to get to the console, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzZFccCEgGA" target="_blank">this video</a> to review.</p>
          <p>Pro tip: If you want to write more than one line of code in the console before running the code, then use <code>shift + enter</code>.</p>
          <p>For each task listed below, enter it in the console:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>25</code></li>
            <li><code>"this is my string"</code> (notice the output's color difference between a number and a string)</li>
            <li><code>var myNewString = "Hello Turing!";</code></li>
            <li><code>myNewString</code> Before you hit Enter, what do you expect to see in the console?</li>
            <li><code>var myNum = 9;</code></li>
            <li><code>myNum</code> Before you hit Enter, what do you expect to see in the console?</li>
            <li><code>var anotherString = "How are You?"</code></li>
            <li><code>"Connect" + " " + "these" + " " + "strings."</code> What happened? This is called string concatenation. Notice the strings with spaces.</li>
            <li><code>myNewString + anotherString</code> This is also string concatenation using variables.</li>
            <li><code>5 > 3</code> returns a boolean value of true. How could you change this expression to return false?</li>
            <li><code>"2" === 2</code> and <code>"2" == 2</code> Why does one of those expressions return true and one return false?</li>
            <li><code>if (8 < 9) {console.log("Hey!")}</code> Before you enter this code in the console, what do you think will happen? Will it log Hey to the console?</li>
            <li>Write an if/else statement where the code in the <code>else</code> block is executed. For example: <code>if (3 < 1){console.log("if block")} else {console.log("else block")}</code></li>
            <li>Use the console to solve <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/TrainingNerd/JavaScriptForBeginners/exercises/variables.html" target="_blank">these problems</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For Chapter 2 in Eloquent JavaScript, there are some practice problems at the end of the chapter. You can use <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/#2" target="_blank">this site</a> to go through and practice those problems.</p>

          <p>Answer these questions about the reading in your prework gist:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>If we have a function defined as <code>function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}</code>, what is the difference between entering <code>sayHello</code> and <code>sayHello()</code> in the console?</li>
            <li>What is the keyword <code>return</code> used for?</li>
            <li>What are function parameters?</li>
            <li>What is the naming convention used for function names?</li>

          <h4>Learn About Your Text Editor - Sublime Text!</h4>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVkR1ZkNusI&list=PLpcSpRrAaOaqQMDlCzE_Y6IUUzaSfYocK" target="_blank">Here is a series of videos</a> to get you started learning about Sublime Text. You'll be using Sublime Text throughout your time at Turing, so it's a good idea to invest some time learning about it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Make A New Webpage Using Sublime Text!</h4>
          <p>Instead of using CodePen to create this webpage, let's use Sublime Text - our text editor. Create a folder (also known as a directory) on your computer to hold your site's files.</p>
          <p>Within your folder, create two files:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>index.html</code> to hold your HTML code</li>
            <li><code>style.css</code> to hold your CSS code</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Your site should contain (but is not limited to):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Content about a subject you are passionate about! (something not about coding)</li>
            <li>Headings</li>
            <li>Text in paragraphs (include two different fonts)</li>
            <li>Links</li>
            <li>Images</li>
            <li>A list (ordered or unordered)</li>
            <li>A form</li>
            <li>Usage of color</li>
          </ul>

          <p>To see the HTML code that you've written in the browser, find the <code>index.html</code> file in Finder, and open it using Chrome. Don't forget to link your stylesheet in your <code>index.html</code> file!</p>
          <p>If you're having trouble using Sublime Text to create a webpage, then go ahead and use CodePen to get something built for your new site, but we would prefer that you use Sublime Text.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>There is a great series of UI/UX posts called <a href="http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals">UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals</a>. Read the first three, short posts: What is UX?, User Goals &amp; Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.</li>
            <li>
            <p>After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.</p>
            <p>Post links to the sites and brief descriptions in your prework gist.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Submit Your Prework</h4>
          <p>Your prework should now consist of three separate gist files:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your technical prework (answers to all of the questions listed on this page and links to your Codepen work)</li>
            <li>Professional Development</li>
            <li>Gear Up</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Submit your prework using the Google form on <a href="https://sites.google.com/casimircreative.com/enrollment/pre-work?authuser=0" target="_blank">this page</a>. Again, your prework submission (with all three gists) is due the Monday before class begins.</b></p>
          <p>Within the first day or two of class, you will also show off the website you made on Day 7. We can't wait to see you in class!</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
