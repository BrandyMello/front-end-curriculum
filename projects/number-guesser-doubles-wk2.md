title: Number Guesser Doubles - Week 2
---

## Overview: Week 2
It's all well and good to play a game guessing a randomly generated by yourself, but eventually you're going to want a little bit more challenge -- so let's refactor our NumberGuesser into a 2-player game!

##### NOTE: All functionality from **Number Guesser Doubles--Week 1** must be completed in addition to the following requirements and phases of work.

- Build a game where a 2 users can guess a number between 1 and 100, with the ability for a custom range to be inputted for increased difficulty of play
- Display the current guess of both players
- Display the final results of each match in card UI
  - each card should display the name of the winner
  - each card should display both player's names
  - each card should show how many guesses it took to guess the correct number
  - each card should have a **delete** button that removes the card from the page
  - **EXTENSION:** each card should display how long the match took
- Game should be fully responsive and usable down to screens/viewport width of 320px
- Project should be pushed to Github with a live site on Github Pages
- Care and attention to detail should be clearly demonstrated in execution of the comp
- Include a README.md in your project that summarizes the project (this does not mean paste this project spec into your README)

##### NOTE REMINDER: you should have the functionality outlined in this project spec completed before you being work on the Week 2 Spec/Additions.

## Phase One: Basic Requirements

The application should have full functionality through Phase Three from [Number Guesser Doubles--Week 1](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk1.html)

#### Week 2: Zero State:
- Two inputs to set a custom range for the random number to fall within
- A button to update the custom range
- for **each player**:
  - An input field for guessing the number which can only accept numeric values
  - An input field for their name that can accept any alpha-numeric character
- One button that submits both players guesses
- One button that resets the game and generates a new random number

#### Players Guess State:
- Display both player's most recent guesses
- Display results and feedback for each players guess:
  - If their guess is too high, it should display the error message: "That's too high"
  - If their guess is too low, it should display the error message: "That's too low"
  - If the guess is correct, it should display the success message: "BOOM!" and create a new card to display results _(card details outline in Phase Four)_

## Phase One: More Better

Display final result of each match in card UI

- Both player name 1 and player name 2 should be displayed
- Winning player is indicated
- total combined guess count of both players is displayed
- delete button removes the card from page

## Phase Two: Level Up extensions (if you complete all of these, reach out to instructors for more goodies)

Work through these **in order**:

- Display how quickly user guesses correct number
- Include at least 3 different animations (example: one for when a card gets created/deleted)
- Easter Egg: use a [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code) to display some secret surprise for users -- have fun, get weird, be creative!!
