# Abstract

Address Book is a two week long paired project intended to solidify your RESTful
API design skills, and get you familiar with the patterns associated with
building a single app across multiple repositories.

Consider how a contact is stored in the Apple ecosystem:

Your job is to create an address book that can recreate some of this
functionality with your own backend and database. A user should be able to
create a new contact, add contact details (phone, email, address, website) for
that person, and be able to update or delete everything about the contact.

Address book will be build in two separate repositories:
- A back-end repository for your database and server
- A front-end repository for your user-facing application, which will consume
  the back-end API
