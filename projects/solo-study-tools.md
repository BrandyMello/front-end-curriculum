# Solo Study Tool

1 week solo project for FE Mod 2 (week 5/6)

## Background and Description


## Goals and Objectives

* Solidify basic React concepts & use of Sass
* Demonstrate your ability to communicate expert-level knowledge on a technical topic
* Uhhhh 

## Requirements

* App must be built in React, and should use Sass for styling
* App must be centered around a technical topic that you've learned or heard about in Mod 1/2, and:
  * demonstrate your expert knowledge on the concept
  * allow others to learn and practice the concept
* App must have some form of interactivity for the user
  * it should **not** just be text on a page with links, though it may include some instructions or resources to learn more
  * interactivity should help your users understand the topic you've selected (e.g. if your topic is DOM manipulation with jQuery, maybe the user can click an element on the page and some text would appear to show them how they would select it with jQuery code) 


## Potential Topic Ideas

* DOM Manipulation with jQuery
* Recursion
* The Call Stack
* Prototypal Inheritance
* Sass/CSS (Should be narrowed down to something specific, like flexbox, pseudoselectors or how the specificity/cascade works)
* Scope
* Prototype Methods
* Git/GitHub Workflow
* Terminal Commands/Navigating the Terminal
* Technical Vocabulary
* Sorting Algorithms
* Pseudocoding/Whiteboarding
* LocalStorage


You are free to pick from this list, use it as inspiration, or pitch your own topic. As you go to pick your topic, take the following into consideration:

* what type of tool do you want to build? are there any topics that lend themselves easily to that learning format?
* what topics were you hoping to learn more thoroughly or what topics did you feel fuzzy on? this is a good opportunity to give yourself a chance to explore them further (e.g. if you have a hard time remembering terminal commands - building a study tool will help you get better at them!)
* your topic should be specific and focused - the more specific your topic, the easier it will be to build a manageable study tool to demonstrate it


## Teaching Tools in the Wild

While your applications don't have to be as complex as the following examples, **do** feel free to be ambitious here and take some risks.
