A common interview assessment is a take-home challenge where you are given a spec and expected to complete the spec requirements on your own. The time span for these challenges vary from a few hours up to a week.

Completing this take-home style challenge tells instructors that you are ready to _get_ the job and are set to be successful in your job search.

This take-home challenge is meant to be completed **on your own**. You are not allowed to consult others about the challenge - you can ask instructors questions about the challenge, and we will answer those questions at our discretion.

## Goals

- Demonstrate front-end engineering knowledge learned throughout time at Turing
- Demonstrate the ability to learn a concept/library/framework that you have not been taught explicitly at Turing
