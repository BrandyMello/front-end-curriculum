title: The Assignment Assignment
module: 4

## Goals

By the end of this project, you will have a well documented portfolio of work that you have completed over your time at Turing. 

During your career, it is wise to collect and document your abilities and the work you have put in to become better at programming. It's helpful to collect this information about yourself when it comes time to ask for a raise, get a new job, or even just sit down and confirm that you're on the right self learning path.

The project, if you choose to accept it, will be due Monday morning of week 6. If major adjustments are needed, you will be permitted to make them over week 6, and, in extraordinary circumstances, over intermission week.

## Rubric


- 4: 

Student demonstrates excellent attention to detail by tracking all completed work this module in a well formatted markdown document, medium blog post or deployed html page.

The majority of assigned work (including design sessions, etc) is included in the document. All assignments listed are completed or next steps to complete well documented. Student includes strong evidence of work. If an assignment is not completed, student documents reason or an alternate assignment they completed.

Student has completed and can demonstrate 2 to 3 blog posts of high quality (meaning the post has either over 750 coherent words - or - the post is short and targetted, including attributions, diagrams, code, etc to effectively explain a subject)

Student has completed some work above and beyond the expectations of the module, including but not limited to running a repeating student lead session, putting together a conference talk proposal and either submitting it or working with a non-student on said proposal, significant open source contribution, speaking at a meetup, etc.

- 3: 

Student demonstrates excellent attention to detail by tracking all completed work this module in a well formatted markdown document, medium blog post or deployed html page. Student may have had to be reminded about what 'well formatted markdown' means.

Around 75% of assigned work (including design sessions, etc) is included in the document. It is not clear in the document what state of completion the work is in. Student shows a reasonable effort to complete assignments.

Student has completed and can demonstrate 1 blog posts of high quality (meaning the post has either over 750 coherent words - or - the post is short and targetted, including attributions, diagrams, code, etc to effectively explain a subject)

- 2: 

Student document is unable to effectively communicate the work that the student accomplished this module.

Significantly less than 75% of assigned work (including design sessions, etc) is included in the document or the majority of work included in the document is in a state of being half done, undocumented and messy.

Document is not in a state where staff would recommend sharing it with a potential future employer.

Student has not written any blog posts or equivalent.
