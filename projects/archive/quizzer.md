## Introduction

In this assessment, you'll be fetching and posting quiz data to a server. You'll do part of the project in preparation and then a second part pairing with an instructor.

**Nota bene**: You may use any technology you choose.

## Preparation

You can build this assessment project with _any_ of the frameworks or libraries of your choosing. In preparation, clone [this repository][qb] and follow the installation and setup instructions in `README.md`. This will act as the back-end for your quiz application and provide you with the API endpoints you need to hit.

In preparation, create a new front-end application that:

- Fetches quiz data from the back-end provided in the [quizzer repo][qb]. Look through the documentation in the `README.md` to determine which API endpoints you'll need to request.
- Displays the quiz and each of its questions & answers.

You end up with something that looks like this:

## Setup

You should come to the assessment with both the back-end repo and your front-end app configured and running.

During the assessment, we'll use additional endpoints to POST quiz data to the server and display the results in the user interface.
