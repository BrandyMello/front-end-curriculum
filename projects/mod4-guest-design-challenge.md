title: Guest Design Challenge
---

### Project overview

This is a ONE HOUR Dynamic Comp Challenge. You will be given a comp to build from a guest designer, and the following week they will join us to critique your solutions.  

Pay attention to details, sweat the small stuff, and be prepared to speak to the choices you made while building the comp and be able to back them up.

Why do this project and why do it in this format? Because it will help you get ready to work with designers when you land at your first gig. Being able to effectively build a comp is an important part of the job, and getting exposure to the level of detail a designer will notice and correct is going to help you become the developer your creative team wants building their work. You will build empathy and understanding around why you need to follow a comp to the letter, and you will be pushed to explain and fully own your choices around building a layout. And remember: the decisions that go into creating a layout are intentional, deliberate, and important.
