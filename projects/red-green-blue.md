## Introduction

This project will challenge you to use the technology you've become familiar
with over the course of Mod 3, as well as force you to work inside some
constraints. Everyone will be working with (at least) one API, one technology, 
and one audience.

Your instructors will pass out cards to each of you. You now have 30 minutes to
haggle with each other. Want a different API? Find someone to trade with.

Once you've got your API, technology, and audience settled, start thinking about
how you're going to build something for this audience, using that tech and API.
Come up with a few different ideas. You'll be meeting with some of your peers
and an instructor shortly to get feedback on each idea.

## Wireframes

Wireframing will be a major component of this project. The more time you spend
intentionally thinking about what the layout of your application will look like,
the better the final result will be.

There are a lot of different tools you can use for this, including just plain
old pen and paper. Just make sure you really spend time thinking about the user
interactions. For a good overview of how to effectively wireframe a project,
check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2Oynq-mOLk).

You will need to make 8-10 wireframes for this project, which you'll review with
your peers and an instructor.

## Project Goals and Requirements

1. Use the technology you've been working with over the course of the module to
   demonstrate mastery of the following:
   - React
   - Redux
   - Router
   - Asynchronous Javascript

2. Work within constraints to deliver a unique product for your audience which
   helps them in some way. Your project must utilize your assigned API and
   technology, and must be built for your assigned audience.

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application utilizes all of the required components, and delivers a
  unique and useful experience for the assigned audience.
- 3 - The application utilizes all the required components.
- 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.
- 1 - The application is missing multiple features essential to having a complete application.

### Code Quality

- 4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
- 2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.
- 1 - Developer did not make any effort to use React effectively or refactor code.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)
- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)
- 2 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad. Attempts to follow [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)
- 1 - Developer did minimal to no CSS for this project besides what was indicated in the comp.

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing
- 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested
- 1 - There was little to no attempt to test this application.

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
- Fail - There are components missing proptype validation.

### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running
- Fail - The boilerplate README is still in place

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

- 4 - Zero complaints
- 3 - Five or fewer complaints
- 2 - Six to ten complaints
- 1 - More than ten complaints

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

- 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

- 2 - Developer(s) make large, inconsistent commits that contain irrelevant changesets and make it difficult to follow the evolution of the application. Developer(s) rarely use git branches and frequently incorporate changes directly into master with little or no review process. There are instances of committed source code that should be .gitignored and instances of dead code and/or debugger statements.

- 1 - Developer(s) make very few commits that each cover too much responsibility and aren't indicative of how the application evolved. Branches and pull requests were not used and changesets were applied directly to master. There are many instances of committed source code that should be .gitignored and many instances of dead code and/or debugger statements.
