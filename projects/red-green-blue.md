## Introduction

This project will challenge you to use the technology you've become familiar
with over the course of Mod 3, as well as force you to work inside some
constraints. Everyone will be working with (at least) one API, one technology, 
and one audience.

Your instructors will pass out cards to each of you. You now have 30 minutes to
haggle with each other. Want a different API? Find someone to trade with.

Once you've got your API, technology, and audience settled, start thinking about
how you're going to build something for this audience, using that tech and API.
Come up with a few different ideas. You'll be meeting with some of your peers
and an instructor shortly to get feedback on each idea.

## Wireframes

Wireframing will be a major component of this project. The more time you spend
intentionally thinking about what the layout of your application will look like,
the better the final result will be.

There are a lot of different tools you can use for this, including just plain
old pen and paper. Just make sure you really spend time thinking about the user
interactions. For a good overview of how to effectively wireframe a project,
check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2Oynq-mOLk).

You will need to make 8-10 wireframes for this project, which you'll review with
your peers and an instructor.
