## Specification

## Learning Goals

### Architecture

Your entire application will consist of one HTML page or template. You will have two javascript files:

1. A `todo-list.js` file that contains a `ToDoList` class.
	* `ToDoList` methods must include, but are not limited to:
		1. `constructor`
		2. `saveToStorage`
		3. `deleteFromStorage`
		4. `completeTask`
2. A `main.js` file that contains all DOM related javascript

### Data Model
* A to-do list has an _id_, _title_, _tasks_, and _urgent_ property.
	* The _id_ property should be a unique indentifier
	* _title_ is a string
	* _urgent_ is a boolean value
	* _tasks_ should be an array of objects 
		* Each _task_ in the array should be an object (you'll need a way to identify these objects, track whether the task has been completed, and store the task's text...)

* See above for the required methods of the `ToDoList` class.

Each todo list on the page should be created as an instance of the `ToDoList` class.
